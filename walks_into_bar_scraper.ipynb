       " ' A guy walks into a bar and asks for 10 shots of the establishment’s finest single malt scotch. The bartender sets him up, and the guy takes the first shot in the row and pours it on the floor. He then takes the last shot in the row and does the same. The bartender asks, \"Why did you do that?\" And the guy replies, \"Well the first shot always tastes like crap, and the last one always makes me sick!\" ',\n",
       " ' Three vampires walk into a bar. The first one says, \"I\\'ll have a pint of blood.\" The second one says, \"I\\'ll have one, too.\" The third one says, \"I\\'ll have a pint of plasma.\" The bartender says, \"So, that\\'ll be two Bloods and a Blood Lite?\" ',\n",
       " ' A guy walks into a bar after a long day at work and orders a drink. As he sits there, mulling over his day, he hears a high-pitched voice say, \"That shirt looks great on you!” The man looks around, doesn’t see anything, and returns to his drink thinking nothing more of it. But then, a moment later, the voice returns, this time offering, “You seem like a really cool guy!” Again, the man looks around, sees nothing, and returns to his drink, wondering if he should get checked out by a professional. Finally, when his nerves have cooled and he believes the voice is gone, he hears, “I bet your parents are really proud of you!” He slams down his drink and looks around wildly. Frustrated and finding no possible source of the voice, he calls over the bartender. He says, “Hey barkeep! What’s that voice I keep hearing?” “Oh, those are the peanuts,” the bartender replies. “They’re complimentary.” ',\n",

Where did he come from?\" The friend pulls out an old lamp and tells him the genie inside will grant him one wish. The man rubs the bottle, and to his amazement, a puff of purple smoke spews out and slowly collects in the form of a genie. In a booming voice the genie tells the man he has but one wish. The man thinks and says, \"I wish I had a million bucks.\" All of a sudden the bar is filled with ducks, bursting from the door and the windows, standing on top of the bar, dunking their heads into people’s drinks. “What just happened?!” the guy asks. His friend replies, \"I know. Did you really think I wanted a 12-inch pianist?\"  ',\n",
       " ' A gorilla walks into a bar and says, \"A scotch on the rocks, please.\" The gorilla hands the bartender a $10 bill. The bartender thinks to himself, \"This gorilla doesn\\'t know the prices of drinks,\" and gives him 15 cents change.

The next day, the duck walks into the bar and before the bartender can say a word, the duck asks, \"Do you have any nails?\" The bartender looks taken aback and says quietly, \"Sorry, don\\'t have nails.\" The duck asks, \"Well then, do you have any peanuts?\" ',\n",

As the horse finishes preparing an excellent Horse’s Neck, he turns to the awestruck patron and demands, \"Hey buddy, what\\'s the matter? You can\\'t believe that a horse can tend bar?\" \"No,\" the guys says. \"I can\\'t believe the ferret sold the place.\" ',\n",

They pass a bar and the lab owner says, \"Let\\'s get a beer.\" The chihuahua walker complains, \"That would be great, but we can\\'t take our dogs in there.\" The first responds, \"Watch me.\" The lab owner strolls in with her dog and orders a beer. The bartender tells her, \"Sorry, you can\\'t bring your dog in here.\" \"He\\'s my seeing eye dog,\" the woman replies feigning offense. The bartender quickly apologizes and serves her the beer. The other woman follows, her chihuahua in tow, and orders a beer as well. Again the bartender says there are no dogs allowed in the bar. \"He\\'s my seeing eye dog,\" the woman replies. \"Yeah, right,” the bartender says, “A chihuahua? Give me a break.\" Without missing a beat, the woman replies, \"They gave me a chihuahua?!\" ',\n",
